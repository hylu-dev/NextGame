# UBISOFT NEXT 2024 | Programming

## Goals

- Transform supporting interpolated movement
  - Ease-in-out, Ease-in, etc...
- 3D Rendering
  - Render 3D objects based on blender obj files
  - **Vertex shading**
- Game Structure
  - 3D Cube that rotates with scene changes
  - Camera aims closely at one side which holds the level
  - Then zooms out, cube rotates, and camera zooms back in on new side
  - Complete all sides to win
- Particle system
  - Consider spline based particles?
  - Verlet integration?
- Pseudo Skybox?
- Randomly generated levels
  - Of course I don't know the game topic
  - I can start though with generating a maze
  - And hopefully use that knowledge to apply to the game topic
